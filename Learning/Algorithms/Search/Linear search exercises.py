# Linear search exercises

1. Search a list of ints for a particular integer. Return the index location, -1 if not found.
2. Search a list of ints for the last occurance of a particular integer. -1 if not found.
3. Search a list of ints for every occurance of a particular integer. Return a list of every index number. Empty list if not found.
4. Search a list of strings for words that start with a substring. Return the first occurance index.
5. Search a list of strings for words that start with a substring. Return list of all the strings (not the index positions).
